    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  - When working on software and design in general, I like to first spend some time figuring out the context for everything and what needs to be done. This moment, the pre-outline stage, allows me to brainstorm up some ideas for
    how to solve the problem before committing to a whole design. I think that this course more than any other has really emphasized the importance of setup before a project. None of the work done on any of the assignments in the class
    would not have been possible had it not been for a rigid review of each of the given resources to try to really understand the concepts that were being exercized. This level of understanding and review is something that I hope
    to carry into future projects, as it greatly speeds up the coding process. What before would have been a ton of time spent googling every which thing, this allowed me to focus more on developing and writing code.
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    - Developing programs usually for me starts with a jump off the deep end. Once I have the basic concepts and ideas on how I want the code to execute, I typically fill in the details during the process. I found in the case of 3D programming
      that this approach was not sufficient enough, and it took a large amount of review to ensure I was properly understanding the course material. Iteration was certainly the largest factor in the development however. No matter how well I
      feel I understand the concepts of scaling, rotating, and positioning objects, I still found the best method was to make incrementally small changes to each object as I placed it, build, and execute, check, make more changes, and repeat.
      This was honestly good practice, because I sometimes fall into the trap of writing a huge amount of code only and not having tested in-between sections, so a ton of time is needed to debug at the end. Incremental programming certainly prevents
      that pitfall and assists heavily with ensuring the program works one step at a time.
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      - I think that computational graphics and visualizations give a great new knowledge and skillset in both the educational and professional field. I work professionally with a development team that builds out the analytical tools for my company.
        One of the major tools they use to that end is webGL, and I feel that this course has given me a much more robust understanding of this tool. It also allows me to sit in on meetings and have half an idea on what folks are talking about. In education,
        I think that these skills will help me in my general development strategies, and will also allow me to potentially suppliment some future project with some 3D programming, which could really take something over the edge.
